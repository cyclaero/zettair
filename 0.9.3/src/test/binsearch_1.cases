# this file contains unit tests for the binsearch module.  See binsearch_1.c for
# more details.
#
# apart from comments, it accepts lines of the form: 
# 
#   nel seed
#
# where nel and seed are both unsigned integers, indicating the number
# of elements and a random seed to apply when sorting.  These tests
# proceed by using the heap to perform a heapsort and then testing
# whether its correctly sorted.
