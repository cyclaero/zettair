# hawkapi.metric is a functional description in our funny zettair metric
# language (see metric.py) of how the 'AF1' metric should operate.  
#
# AF1 is Dave Hawking's anchor-text specific okapi variant (see 'Toward better
# weighting of anchors', Hawking, Upstill and Craswell, SIGIR 2004 poster).
# They called it 'AF1', but i find hawkapi a little less boring ;o).
# It's basically a stripped-down version of the okapi metric.  No-one
# really knows, at this stage (including Dave Hawking, when i asked him), 
# what a good value of alpha is.
