## Zettair
Zettair is a compact and fast text search engine produced by the Search Engine 
Group at RMIT. It was designed for simplicity as well as speed and flexibility.  
One of its primary features is the ability to handle large amounts of text 
efficiently. It was previously named lucy, and was renamed around May, 2004.

Installation instructions can be found in the file named INSTALL. Zettair was
written in C and has been tested on Solaris and Linux. It is available for 
download from http://www.seg.rmit.edu.au.
