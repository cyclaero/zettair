/* metric_template.c contains the boilerplate code and formatted comments that
 * allow metric.py to turn metric definitions into working code.
 * The format consists of c code interspersed by formatted comments that are
 * expanded with definitions from the metric defintion file.  The comments must
 * be wholly on a single line, with nothing else on the line.  Replacements:
 *
 *   METRIC_NAME : name of the metric 
 *   METRIC_PRE : code for setting up things pre-accumulation
 *   METRIC_POST : code for post-processing accumulators
 *   METRIC_POST_PER_DOC : code for post-processing a single accumulator
 *   METRIC_DECL : declarations needed for processing accumulators
 *   METRIC_PER_CALL : code that doesn't depend on anything
 *   METRIC_PER_DOC : code that depends on the document
 *   METRIC_CONTRIB: calculate the average contribution of an f_dt value
 *   METRIC_DEPENDS_POST : 1 if the metric has a post-processing step, 
 *                         0 otherwise 
 *
 * This starting comment is replaced in the output files with the starting 
 * comment from the metric definition file and some additional boilerplate.
