moby.txt contains the full text of Herman Melville's
"Moby Dick; or The Whale" (1851), converted into TREC
format, with each paragraph forming a document.  We use a
CHAPTER, PARAGRAPH heading in place of the TREC document
number.  It can be indexed with a command similar to:

  zet -i -t TREC moby.txt

and then, from the same directory,

  zet -q capitalise

to run queries and get document summaries in the results,
with query terms highlighted by capitalisation.
